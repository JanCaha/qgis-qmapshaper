# Interactive Simplifier

The tool is an interactive version of [Simplify Vector](../tools/tool_simplify.md), providing the same settings but allowing to immediately check the outcome of the simplification (as soon as it is calculated) and if deemed fine the outcome can be exported back to QGIS project.
