# Interactive Mapshaper Console

The tool is an interactive version of [Mapshaper Console](../tools/tool_console.md), providing the same settings but allowing to immediately check the outcome of the console command (as soon as it is calculated) and if deemed fine the outcome can be exported back to QGIS project.
