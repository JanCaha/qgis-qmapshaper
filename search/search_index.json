Link to QGIS Plugin repository Plugin is available here: https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qmapshaper/ . Installation Requires installation of NodeJS, npm and mapshaper. Linux On most Linux distributions this should do: sudo apt install nodejs sudo apt install npm npm install mapshaper You can also install mapshaper globally for the system. npm install -g mapshaper Windows On Windows the setup may vary. You then need the path to mapshaper folder in node_modules . See details below. Setting up In QGIS settings under Processing under QMapshaper the mapshaper folder needs to be set up. On Linux this tends to be: /home/user_name/node_modules/mapshaper , where you just replace user_name with your user name. If this is not the case you have to investigate, where the folder is. Best way might be to search for file mapshaper-gui which is located in the mapshaper/bin directory. There is also Mapshaper tool name setting that allows user to change the name of binary file to run. On Linux, this should not be needed but on Windows the command can be either mapshaper-xl or also mapshaper-xl.cmd . Tools So far there is processing tool Simplify vector usable in complex workflows. There is also Interactive Simplifier which is GUI tool that allows playing around interactively with the simplification parameters.
