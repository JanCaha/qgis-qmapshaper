# QMapshaper

**Work in progress !!!** Development of the QGIS plugin to turn [mapshaper](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper) into QGIS tool.

## Installation

Requires installation of NodeJS, npm and mapshaper.

On most Linux distributions this should do:

```
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
npm install mapshaper
```

## Setting up

In **QGIS settings** under **Processing** under **QMapshaper** the **_mapshaper_** folder needs to be set up.

On Linux this tends to be: `/home/user_name/node_modules/mapshaper`, where you just replace `user_name` with your user name.
